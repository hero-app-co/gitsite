        HERO began when one of my best friend’s got a DUI while I was at home, and could have easily given him a ride. When I asked him, “Why didn’t you call me?” what he said next really resonated. He stated that he didn’t know I was available and that he would have called 5 or 6 people, potentially waking them or upsetting them before he’d have gotten to my number in his phone. I realized that there was no simple way for me to let those I care about know that I am available and willing to help.

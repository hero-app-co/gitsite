        Back in 2014, a friend of mine lost his military flight career to a DUI while I was sitting at home, and could have easily given him a ride.
        When I bailed him out the next day, I asked him, “Why didn’t you call me?” and what he said next really resonated with me. He said he would have called 6 people and pissed them all off before even getting to me.
        It started to make me think, and realize that there was no simple way to know who’s available, and willing in the middle of the night to pick up a friend.
      <br><br>
        That’s when the idea for HERO started. We wanted to create a solution to effectively put an end to the 1.4 million DUI’s and 10,000 associated deaths that occur annually.
        We have partnered with leaders in the community, insurance &amp; alcohol industries, and local businesses to accomplish our goal.
        We are working to unite communities behind a central solution to reduce drunk driving.

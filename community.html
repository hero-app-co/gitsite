        Drinking and driving affects the culture of the college campus. When disaster happens, everyone in the campus community is affected. HERO strives to create close campus ties focusing on the campus community, building relationships, and developing a lasting positive impact.
        <br><br>
        Partnering with drinking and driving campaigns with the university programs as well as being involved in campus events, to promote the use of HERO among college students. This would ensure greater awareness and visibility of the options available to college students therefore creating a greater sense of community among the University campus, making them safer, and changing the drinking and driving culture.
        <br><br>
        Our main focus is student safety, secondly we focus on developing a sense of community; all the while we are working to make the roads safer, students safer, and our communities safer in which we are a part of.
